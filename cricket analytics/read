## Created a Power BI report to identify the top 11 players for a T20 cricket team by scrapingdata from ESPN Cricinfo with a Brightdata website tool, cleaning and transforming the data with pandas, and evaluating various player performance metrics
## Used the resulting Power BI dashboard to select players for various categories (openers, middle order/anchors, finishers, all-rounders, specialist fast bowlers) and ultimately choose the top 11 players to play in the match.
